        <p className="text-gray-600">
          FITRACKER was created out of a passion for fitness and a desire to
          make tracking workouts easier. As fitness enthusiasts, we often found
          ourselves struggling to keep track of our progress and routines. This
          led to the development of FITRACKER—a tool that not only simplifies
          workout tracking but also empowers users to achieve their fitness
          goals.
